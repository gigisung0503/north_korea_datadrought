### Title: DataDrought: Bridging Digital Deserts in Climate Crisis
#### Case Study: Unveiling North Koreaâ€™s Flood Impact Through Satellite Analytics 

In addressing climate injustices, we've chosen to focus on regions like North Korea, where data scarcity deepens the impact of natural disasters. DataDrought, our initiative for the UN Datathon 2023, seeks to enhance digital connectivity and local action in areas affected by climate crises.</br></br>

Our project uses satellite analytics to make sense of climate hazards and supports efforts that align with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, we aim to strengthen climate action, educational opportunities, and innovation through improved data use.</br></br>

DataDrought is designed to reveal the hidden extent of climate disasters in data-poor regions, offering a scalable model for global application. It's a commitment to digital inclusivity and local empowerment in the face of climate challenges, aiming to transform satellite images into tools for resilience and recovery.</br></br>

### What is Next?

Utilizing satellite imagery to analyze flood impacts in North Korea has been a groundbreaking experience. We're scaling this approach to develop a dashboard that automates damage assessments and resource evaluations for use by government agencies and emergency responders in disaster situations.
